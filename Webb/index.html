      Incan women were typically married at the age of sixteen because of poverty , while men married at the age of twenty. Age, however, was not as important as keeping track of the stage of life that a person was at, such as whether or not they were able to work or be married. Ranks played a role in a person's marriage status as well. Men of lower rank could have only one wife; people of ranks higher than the kuraka were allowed more If a man had more than one wife, one served as the principal wife while the other(s) were considered secondary.

      More than 650 million women and girls alive today were married before their 18th birthday. Twenty-one per cent of young women (20-24 years old) around the world were child brides. And while early marriage is most prevalent in low- and middle-income countries, it also takes place in high-income countries. some are forced to marry in an early age with an adult because of religious reasons and traditions. There is good news: global child marriage rates are slowly falling. Around 2000, one in three women between the ages of 20 and 24 reported they had been married as children. In 2017, this number was just over one in five. Rates of child marriage before age 15 also fell, from 11 per cent in 2000 to 5 per cent in 2017.
